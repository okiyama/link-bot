# link-bot
A bot for having Link play songs in Majora's Mask. Uses Bizhawk's lua scripting capabilities.
Currently capable of loading up a MIDI with one track that only plays one note at a time then playing it.
Will also attempt to automatically transpose to fit in Link's range if the provided MIDI is too high or too low.

TODO:

* Allow user to choose which track link should play
* Handle chords on one track somehow
* Play more complex songs and make a video out of it. This should include the controller inputs.
